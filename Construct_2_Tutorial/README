The UCSC Game Design Department was considering a new software to use in an undergraduate class.
The software I was currently using in the class was GameMaker, which involved coding in GML (OO-language).

Since the dept. wanted to make the class more accessible for those w/o much coding experience,
they wanted to explore Construct 2, a simpler script-based app.

My job was to convert my game in GameMaker, to Construct 2, recording the whole process, with
some tutorial details of basic features (to give an idea of usage complexity),
to see if the development process was shorter and simpler with the new software.

The UCSC Game Design Department ended up switching software to Construct 2, in all future renditions of the class.
